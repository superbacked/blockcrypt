# Blockcrypt technical documentation

## Abstract

This document specifies the cryptographic design and implementation of Blockcrypt. Blockcrypt encrypts one or more secrets — each using its own passphrase — into a fixed-size block whose encrypted headers, encrypted data and random padding are indistinguishable from one another, providing plausible deniability. Blockcrypt is the encryption primitive behind [Superbacked](https://superbacked.com) blocks. The source ([src/index.ts](../src/index.ts)) is the ground truth for this document.

## Introduction

A block encrypted using Blockcrypt reveals only its size. Every byte — headers, data and padding — is either ciphertext or random, so the number of secrets, their sizes and their boundaries cannot be determined. Only the first secret is expected — every block holds at least one — so plausible deniability covers the secrets beyond it: additional secrets are concealed in the padding, and without their passphrases, no one can tell whether they exist at all. Decrypting the first secret reveals nothing about the others; decrypting a later secret reveals that one or more secrets precede it in the block — though nothing more, nor whether more secrets exist.

## Terminology

- **Block**: the output of encryption — salt, initialization vector, headers and data.
- **Data**: the concatenated ciphertexts of all secrets, followed by random padding.
- **Header**: an encrypted `start:length` pointer that locates one secret’s ciphertext within data.
- **KDF**: the caller-supplied key derivation function mapping a passphrase and salt to a 32-byte key.
- **Legacy mode**: a compatibility mode for blocks created before HKDF subkeys were introduced.
- **Secret**: a message and the passphrase that protects it.

## Block format

| Field     | Size                                                   | Content                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `salt`    | 16 bytes                                               | Random; passed to the KDF alongside each passphrase.                                                                                                                  |
| `iv`      | 16 bytes                                               | Random; initialization vector for header encryption.                                                                                                                  |
| `headers` | `headersLength` bytes (multiple of 16, defaults to 64) | One AES-256-CBC-encrypted header per secret, padded to `headersLength` with random bytes.                                                                             |
| `data`    | `dataLength` bytes (multiple of 16)                    | One AES-256-GCM-encrypted message per secret, followed by its 12-byte initialization vector and 16-byte authentication tag, padded to `dataLength` with random bytes. |

The lengths set a block’s capacity: each encrypted header occupies 16 bytes (32 when its `start:length` pointer runs past 15 characters), so the default 64-byte headers hold up to four secrets (Superbacked uses 48-byte headers, holding up to three). When `dataLength` is not set, it defaults to twice the length the first secret occupies in data, rounded up to the next multiple of 64 bytes — a block holding one secret reserves room for more, so its size does not disclose that nothing is hidden. Encryption fails loudly when secrets exceed either length. The `getDataLength` helper returns the length a message will occupy in data so callers can determine `dataLength` before encrypting.

## Key derivation

Blockcrypt does not bundle a KDF — the caller supplies one with the signature `(passphrase, salt) → 32-byte key`, and its strength (memory-hardness, parameters) is the caller’s responsibility. Superbacked supplies Argon2.

For each secret, the KDF derives a key from its passphrase and the block’s salt (base64-encoded). Two subkeys are then derived from it using HKDF-SHA256: one with info `headers` encrypting the secret’s header, one with info `data` encrypting the secret’s message — so header and data ciphertexts never share a key. In legacy mode the KDF output is used directly as both keys.

## Encryption

For each secret:

1. Derive the header and data keys from its passphrase (see [Key derivation](#key-derivation)).
2. Encrypt the message using AES-256-GCM with the data key and a fresh random 12-byte initialization vector.
3. Append the secret’s data entry — ciphertext, initialization vector, authentication tag — to data.
4. Encrypt the pointer `start:length` (the ciphertext’s offset within data and its length) using AES-256-CBC with the header key and the block’s initialization vector, and append it to headers.

Headers and data are then padded to their configured lengths with random bytes, and the block — salt, initialization vector, headers, data — is returned.

## Decryption

Decryption takes a single passphrase and scans for a header it can decrypt: every contiguous byte range of headers is tried until one decrypts — under the passphrase’s header key — to a plaintext matching `start:length`. No slot index or count is stored anywhere; a header is found by successfully decrypting it, or it does not exist as far as that passphrase can tell.

The pointer locates the secret’s ciphertext within data, the initialization vector and authentication tag follow it, and the message is decrypted and verified using AES-256-GCM. A wrong passphrase and an absent secret fail identically (`Header not found`) — the error does not reveal whether there was anything to find.

## Security properties

- **Authenticated encryption**: every secret carries an AES-256-GCM authentication tag — a tampered ciphertext or a wrong key fails to decrypt, it does not decrypt to garbage.
- **Plausible deniability**: headers, data and padding are mutually indistinguishable, so a block reveals nothing about how many secrets it holds beyond the first, which is always present. Revealing a secret’s passphrase proves nothing about any secret that follows it; a later secret’s position reveals only that one or more secrets precede it.
- **Size uniformity**: headers and data are padded to fixed lengths, and the default `dataLength` reserves headroom beyond the first secret — size discloses neither count nor content.
- **Key separation**: header and data ciphertexts use independent HKDF subkeys, and each secret’s keys derive from its own passphrase.

## Known limitations

- The block is not authenticated as a whole: each secret’s data is protected by its authentication tag, but headers and padding are not. Tampering cannot forge or alter a secret, but it can make one unrecoverable — keep copies of a block if availability matters.
- Plausible deniability has a floor and a direction: every block provably holds at least one secret, so only the secrets beyond the first are deniable — and disclosing a later secret’s passphrase reveals, through its position, that one or more secrets precede it. Deniability is strongest when only the first secret is ever disclosed.
- Deniability covers the block, not its handling: passphrase management and the decision of what to disclose remain with the user.
- The KDF is injected, so the cost of brute-forcing passphrases is set by the caller’s choice, not by Blockcrypt.
